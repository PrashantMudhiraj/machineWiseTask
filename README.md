# Industrial IoT Dashboard

Hey there! This is my implementation of a real-time industrial IoT dashboard. I built it to monitor machine sensor data and display it in a clean, easy-to-understand way.

## What Does It Do?

This dashboard helps factory floor managers monitor their machines by showing:

-   Temperature readings (with alerts if it gets too hot!)
-   Vibration levels (because too much shaking is never good)
-   Current and voltage readings (keeping the power in check)
-   Overall machine status (Healthy, Warning, or Critical)

The best part? It updates automatically every 5 seconds, so you're always looking at fresh data!

## How I Built It

I split this into two parts to keep things organized:

### The Backend (The Brain)

-   Built with Node.js and Express
-   Creates realistic-looking sensor data (since I don't have real sensors!)
-   Smart enough to know when a machine might be in trouble
-   Updates data in real-time

### The Frontend (The Face)

-   Built with React
-   Shows data in a clean, easy-to-read layout
-   Uses color-coding to make problems easy to spot
-   Works great on both desktop and mobile screens

```
